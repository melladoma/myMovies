# myMovies

Movies website app to find all latest releases and keep them in a wishlist.

Coded in JS + React JSX, backend as webservice built with Express, movies informations are fetched from The Movie Database API and wishlist is stored within a MongoDB database.

Home page displays latest releases to date.
For each movie, users can see global rating, they can also give their own rating, increment the number of times they viewed the movie and add it to their wishlist.

This is my first project in React, using inverse data flow between app and movie components.
